More time is required on this project to address the following items and render the solution fully complete:

Functionality:
1.) Issue with jQuery AJAX success/failure condition - all calls currently entering the failure block despite succeessfully returning correct data. Address this 
issue then tidy up the failure condition block.
2.) Issues with references to PartialViewResult from HomeController unit test. Resolve this referencing issue.
3.) Add validation code to UI and back end to ensure only correct data can be entered.
4.) Add Datepicker control to the UI and remove direct data entry to the date text box.
5.) Add exception handling and improvements to code to handle null data etc.

Misc Issues:
1.) Add styling via customised css file(s)
2.) Tidy locations of referenced .js and .css files and ensure only local minimsed versions are referenced rather than versions from CDN locations etc

To Do:
1.) Further tests / end to end tests / integration tests
2.) Add build to a CI tool such as Team City
3.) Ensure commits are more frequent rather than the single commit to GitHub
4.) Add code comments to allow for automated documentation
5.) Add logging to error handling code
6.) Add security to UI and middle-tier layers
7.) Addiional functionalty to print / export data to csv etc.
